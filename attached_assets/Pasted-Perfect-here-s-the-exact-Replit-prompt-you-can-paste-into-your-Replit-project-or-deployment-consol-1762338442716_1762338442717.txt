### UX TONE & MICROCOPY

Make all interface and button labels slightly more human and fluid:
- “Join Room” → “Enter Flow”

- “Leaderboard” → “Flowboard”
- “Profile” → “Your Field”

---

- *Description:* AMURA is the modern connection platform for creators, leaders, and visionaries. Keep promises visible, relationships alive, and your flow in motion.  
- *Favicon:* Upload amura-symbol.png (loop A mark).

---

### STRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- Ensure top navigation reads: Home | Features | Circles | Organizers | Login  
- Update footer:

© 2025 AMURA. Keep the flow alive.

- Replace any remaining references to “ALIGN” in comments, metadata, or IDs with “AMURA”.

---

### OPTIONAL (for polish)

✅ Keep all structure intact, just rename, recolor, and upgrade copy + animations.

Would you like me to generate a second prompt that specifically transforms the app dashboard (inside /app/index.html) into AMURA UI with Flow Circles, Promise Tracker, and Flowboard included? That would complete the whole ecosystem update.
