Perfect — that’s exactly the right mindset. Let’s make this airtight and executable.

Here’s the full step-by-step roadmap for building ALIGN on Replit — from zero to a live, testable app people can use at your event and later scale.


---

🧭 OVERVIEW

You’ll build in two layers:

1. Landing Page (Public Front Door) – where people see the brand, understand it, and sign up / join.


2. Application (Inside Experience) – where users actually create profiles, join rooms, and interact.



Both live under one Replit project (or two if you prefer separation later).


---

🪜 STEP-BY-STEP PLAN

Step 1 – Create the Replit Project

In Replit, click “Create → HTML/CSS/JS” project.

Name it align or align-app.

Paste the HTML from the document I gave you into index.html.

Click Run → confirm the landing page renders correctly.
✅ Now you have your marketing + signup layer.



---

Step 2 – Add the “Web App Core” (User Rooms & Profiles)

You’ll now extend it into an actual Progressive Web App (PWA).

2.1 – Create a sub-folder called /app

Inside /app you’ll build:

index.html — the app interface

script.js — logic

style.css — reuse Tailwind via CDN


2.2 – Use Firebase (Free backend)

Go to firebase.google.com, create a free project “ALIGN”.

Enable Authentication (Email + Google) and Firestore Database.

Copy the config snippet → paste into your script.js.


This gives you:

import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.7.1/firebase-app.js";
import { getFirestore, collection, addDoc, getDocs } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.7.1/firebase-firestore.js";

Then users can:

Sign in

Create a profile { name, offer, ask, links, room }

Join a “Room” document


✅ This turns ALIGN from a static page into a live event network.


---

Step 3 – Link the Landing Page → App

On the landing page buttons (“Join Room”, “Get ALIGN”), set the link:

<a href="/app/index.html">Open ALIGN App</a>

Now your front site leads directly into the live app experience.


---

Step 4 – Add QR Connect (optional now)

Use a simple JS library like qrcodejs:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcodejs/qrcode.min.js"></script>
<div id="qrcode"></div>
<script>new QRCode(document.getElementById("qrcode"), userProfileURL);</script>

That generates each user’s QR automatically for others to scan and connect.


---

Step 5 – Polish the Flow

1. Landing page → Join → /app


2. User logs in, fills their profile (Offer, Ask, Links).


3. Chooses or joins event “Room”.


4. Sees feed of others (Firestore collection).


5. Can add daily action logs.


6. Leaderboard sorts by streak count.




---

Step 6 – Deploy & Share

Click “Deploy” in Replit → Shareable URL (e.g., https://align.yourname.repl.co).

Print QR code of that link → attendees scan → open the landing page → enter app.



---

Step 7 – Next Iteration (Post-Event)

After your first 50+ users:

Add custom subdomain via Cloudflare or Vercel (alignapp.io).

Add Stripe for organizers ($99 / event tier).

Later, move the Replit code to Vite/React if you want a native-like interface.

⚙ Summary of Your Immediate Action Plan

Order	Task	Outcome

1	Create Replit project, paste landing page code	Live website ready
2	Set up /app folder & Firebase config	Backend connection
3	Build basic profile + room form	Functional prototype
4	Add QR generator	In-person connection
5	Test at event	Collect feedback
6	Polish UI + analytics + Stripe	Monetize
7	Deploy to alignapp.io	Public launch

If you’d like, I can now generate for you the Firebase-connected app files (app/index.html, script.js, style.css) — ready to drop into your Replit project — so you’ll have the full working prototype.

Would you like me to create those next?
